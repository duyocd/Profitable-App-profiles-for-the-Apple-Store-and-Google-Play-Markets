# Profitable App Profiles for the Apple Store and Google Play Markets
---
My aim in this project is to find app profiles that are profitable for the Apple Store and Google Play markets. Let's say I'm working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and my job is to enable the developer team to make data-driven decisions about the types of apps they're working on. build.

At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. My goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of appms are likely to attract more users.

This is my first project in data analysis research. 
Thanks for watching.
